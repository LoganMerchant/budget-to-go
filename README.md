# Budget to Go


## Description
Budget to Go is a progressive web application that allows users to keep track of their financial transactions, whether or not they have an internet connection. They simply add the page to their phone via their browser, and they will be able to better keep track of the deposits and withdrawals from their accounts.

## Installation
If a user is on a desktop, they simply need to install the application via the options in their browser. If a user would like to have the application on the go (as is intended), they can add the application from their phone's browser by adding it to their home screen via the browser's share settings.


## Usage
All that you need to do in order to use this application is type the name of the transaction, how much is being deposited or withdrawn, and selected "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds".


## How to Contribute
The application's front end could be more robust, as could the backend. Version 1.0 of Budget to Go has a very simple database, which keeps all transactions on one document. This obviously isn't ideal as several users could use this in the future. Both the front end and back end will need to be expanded to allow users to sign up for an individualized experience. This would include sign ups, log ins, and individual transactions being tracked on each user's own database document.
